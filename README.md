## Ombudsmen

- Ombudsmen investigate and resolve complaints about public and private organisations. They are often a last resort when complaints cannot be sorted out though an organisation's own complaints procedure.
- Ombudsmen are free to use, and their decision isn't binding. This means you can use another dispute resolution process or take your case to court if you're unhappy with the decision.

### First, check if your deposit protected by deposit protection schemes

* [Deposits - Shelter Scotland](https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/paying_for_a_home/deposits)

* [Tenancy deposit schemes - Shelter Scotland](https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/paying_for_a_home/deposits/tenancy_deposit_schemes)

  * ## Tenancy deposit schemes

    Private landlords, letting agents and student accommodation providers have to protect your deposit in a tenancy deposit scheme. They must do this within 30 working days of your tenancy starting.

    A tenancy deposit scheme is where your deposit money will be stored during your tenancy. It protects your deposit. It prevents the landlord taking money out of the deposit during your tenancy.

    There is no cost for the tenant when a landlord protects a deposit.

    There are three schemes that are Scottish Government approved.

    - [MyDeposits Scotland](https://www.mydepositsscotland.co.uk/)
    - [Safe Deposits Scotland](https://www.safedepositsscotland.com/)
    - [Letting Protection Service Scotland](https://www.lettingprotectionscotland.com/)

    Be wary if a letting agent or landlord asks you to use any scheme for deposits other than those listed above. Read any small print before agreeing to use any other scheme as they will not offer the same protection.

* [Deposits that do not need to be protected - Shelter Scotland](https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/paying_for_a_home/deposits/unprotected_deposits)

  * Your deposit does not need to be protected with a deposit scheme if:

    - you live with your landlord
    - your landlord is a family member
    - you stay in a holiday home
    - you stay in a property used by a religious organisation
    - you live in supported accommodation
    - you have an agricultural or crofting tenancy

    Most other deposits will need to be protected in a [deposit protection scheme](https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/paying_for_a_home/deposits/tenancy_deposit_schemes).

### If your deposit should be protected by schemes:

* ### If you think the landlords make deductions from your deposit unreasonably

  * [Tools and Guides - SafeDeposits Scotland](https://www.safedepositsscotland.com/resource-centre/tools-and-guides/)

  * ## Getting your protected deposit back

    Your landlord should tell the tenancy deposit scheme when your tenancy ends. They will tell the scheme if they want to make deductions from your deposit before it is returned to you.

    The deposit scheme will ask you if you agree with the deductions. If you do not agree then you can request a dispute resolution.

    ### Dispute resolution for protected deposits

    If you ask to use the resolution process then your landlord has to enter into it with you.

    You may need to show that you have tried to negotiate with your landlord first.

    The scheme will take into account evidence that you and your landlord give them. A decision should be reached within 20 working days.

    You can ask for a review if you disagree with the decision.

    Safe Deposits Scotland [guidance on how the dispute process works](https://www.safedepositsscotland.com/landlord-information/guidance-documents/).

* ### If you think your deposit is not protected

  Contact each of the three deposit schemes and ask if your deposit is protected with them.

  Each scheme has an enquiry form to request this information. You can also call them. These telephone numbers may not be free to call.

  ### MyDeposits Scotland

  [Deposit enquiry form](https://www.mydepositsscotland.co.uk/tenant/)
  0333 321 9402

  ### Safe Deposits Scotland

  ### Letting Protection Service Scotland

  [Deposit Enquiry Form](https://www.lettingprotectionscotland.com/is-my-deposit-protected)
  0330 303 0031

  If the deposit is not protected with any of the schemes you will be entitled to compensation. Getting written confirmation from each scheme is important evidence to have when applying for compensation.

  ### Getting your unprotected deposit back

  If your landlord does not return your unprotected deposit at the end of your tenancy you can claim the money back. The tribunal can order the landlord to pay the money back to you.

  Use [application form F to apply to the tribunal](https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/sites/default/files/hpc/Form F Civil Proceedings Application [Revised May 2018].pdf). Include in your application:

  - what money you believe you are owed
  - evidence of you paying the landlord a deposit, such as a bank statement or receipt from the landlord
  - evidence that it was not protected with a scheme

  If you have a private residential tenancy the tribunal rule number is 111. For an assured or short assured tenancy it is rule 70.

  This is separate from applying for compensation. It can be made at the same time if you want to get your deposit back and get compensation as well.

# Tips

1. If the agent always talks to you about important things by phone, you should ask them to write an email to you as your written proof.

2. Take pictures of room condition when move in/out and keep evidense.

3. A deposit cannot be used to replace items that are damaged or worn due to normal wear and tear. This includes worn carpets and furniture.
   Property Mark's [guide to fair wear and tear](https://www.propertymark.co.uk/professional-standards/consumer-guides/landlords/fair-wear-and-tear.html).

## When you pay your deposit

Make sure you:

- agree the deposit amount in writing (including what it may be used for)
- get a receipt for the amount paid
- understand how it will be returned at the end of your tenancy

Check the property and the items on the inventory when you move in. Take photos of their condition. This can help if there is a dispute at the end of the tenancy.

You can [create your own inventory](https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/paying_for_a_home/deposits/making_an_inventory) if your landlord does not provide one.
